- What is the social and historical rhetorical situation for you and the author? In other words, how does your rhetorical situation within this society and within this time (the United States in the 2020's) differ from the rhetorical situation the author faced within her society and time? What makes each of you distinct and different writers? *This might take some Googling!  
	- Its not hard to understand, connect, and describe the life experiences Machiavelli experienced that contributed  the book he wrote. He grew up and became politically involved in one of the most unstable turbulent environments in century's, the Italian city states. All sorts of organizations rose and fell in a knife fight for control over the states. From the Kings of France and Spain, to military alliances, mercenary and the Holy-Roman empire everyone wanted a piece of Italian pie, reign was short and life was shorter. Machiavelli experienced this firsthand when Florence sent him on a diplomatic mission to Pistoia in an attempt to level out the flaring tensions between rioting factions in the city. While he did ultimately fail, he did get to meet [Cesare Borgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Borgia) a ruthless cardinal who inspired Machiavelli to write the prince who used the power of the church to take control of central Italy.  With these experiences in his tool belt Machiavelli then went on to create his own small little faction in Florence. A 400 strong militia made up mostly of civilians (not mercenaries importantly, Machiavelli distrusted the "unpatriotic" and "fickle" nature of hired soldiers). They were able to take Pisa (eg: Leaning Tower of Pisa) in central Italy in 1509 but quickly lost it in 1512 to the Medici (Noble Italian banking family).  Machiavelli's faction didn't survive very long, but neither did any other faction. This might be the reason why Machiavelli does not advocate for cultivating long term relationships with citizens.
	- It is much harder meanwhile for me to describe my personal relationship with rule and power. historians and political analysts have not mapped my influences as they have with Machiavelli. There are some broad places for me to look through though. One of the biggest being the internet. I live in an environment where appearances are king and community’s keep getting nicher and nicher. Where some folks start genuinely using words like “corecore” or “tanky” to describe the culture of the crazily specific spaces they inhabit. It’s an environment that requires intellectuals to use ever more technical language like “post ironic” to describe how the ways we communicate have been increasingly muddled, and certain groups use sophisticated modern sophistry to get what they want. Where we’re growing more polarized and ideas can’t be as easily shared anymore. And ultimately, politically I think it’s pitiful. There’s almost a sense of defeatism on the internet that I see when I scroll past memes and read blog posts. I don’t think the young people on the internet  who are politically involved or interested have a lot of faith in politicians, or rulers, or each other. while I may not live in a time that is as violent as Machiavelli’s I think all this cynicism connects almost directly to the figure, which is why he’s so interesting to me.
    
- Write an audience analysis for your chosen reading and your own essay by responding to the questions listed under the "Thinking about Audience" section. *Answer the questions for both texts. 
	- as with the first question the answer is similarly clear, or at least clearly documented. Machiavelli had someone specific in mind when he wrote the prince. The Medici ruler, Lorenzo. He intended to use the book to gain favor of the current administration and pivot back into politics. according to the prince reading [guide](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/531158/the-prince-by-niccolo-machiavelli/9780140449150/readers-guide/#:~:text=Dedicated%20to%20Lorenzo%20de'%20Medici,five%20years%20after%20Machiavelli's%20death.) published by penguin it was “his effort, though unsuccessful, to gain an advisory post in the Medici government.”. While this is the case the books utility has expanded from being a mere 90 page tool for Machiavellis political machination into a short guidebook for all leaders in modern politics. 
	- My audience is much more humble. This essay is for me. Yes it’s also obviously a grade for a school assignment but the latter use takes priority for me. I had already planned on studying this book before this class and it’s convenient that I can use this assignment as an opportunity to do it in a more structured school environment. Because my primary audience is me I’m going to try and keep an open mind and consider lots of avenues and opinions I have about the work, I will use the dialogue format to process what I think of Machiavellis realist system.
    
- Thinking back on last week's readings from the _Field_ Guide "Comparing and Contrasting", "Describing", and "Narrating", what strategies made your selected textbook essay a successful piece of writing? What writing strategies could you use to make your piece of writing affect the reader?
- 

- Consider all of your prewriting up to this point, how does considering your rhetorical situation help you to prepare for the drafting phase? What final shifts does it help you make to your approach as you prepare to compose your essay?
	- Sometimes when I’m writing for class I get into a habit of taking a stance or an opinion so I can use the dialogue generated through my response to my (sometimes newly formed) opinions to strengthen them and explore ideas in a dynamic way. But I don't always have access to a group of smart people in a classroom or intellectual setting. Considering my rhetorical situation reminded me of the importance of processing my thoughts on my own, and the dialogue format we are using for this assignment I feel can probably help me do that.
