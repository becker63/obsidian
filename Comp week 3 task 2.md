- What is the social and historical rhetorical situation for you and the author? In other words, how does your rhetorical situation within this society and within this time (the United States in the 2020's) differ from the rhetorical situation the author faced within her society and time?

	- Its not hard to understand, connect, and describe the life experiences Machiavelli experienced that contributed  the book he wrote. He grew up and became politically involved in one of the most unstable turbulent environments in century's, the Italian city states. All sorts of organizations rose and fell in a knife fight for control over the states.

Machiavelli experienced this firsthand when Florence sent him on a diplomatic mission to Pistoia in an attempt to level out the flaring tensions between rioting factions in the city. While he did ultimately fail, he did get to meet [Cesare Borgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Borgia) a ruthless cardinal who inspired Machiavelli to write the prince who used the power of the church to take control of central Italy.  With these experiences in his tool belt Machiavelli then went on to create his own small little faction in Florence. A 400 strong militia made up mostly of civilians (not mercenaries importantly, Machiavelli distrusted there "unpatriotic" and "fickle" nature). They were able to take Pisa (eg: Leaning Tower of Pisa) in central Italy in 1509 but quickly lost it in 1512 to the Medici (Noble Italian banking faction).  Machiavelli's faction didn't survive very long, but neither did any other faction. This might be the reason why Machiavelli does not advocate for cultivating long term relationships with your citizens in his works.
